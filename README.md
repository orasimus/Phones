# Phone contact information transformer

Transforms contact information from a vcf format to vcard format. The latter is accepted by Google Contacts import.

I wrote this program because I had to figure a way to export Lumia 900 (Windows Phone 7.8) contacts to Google Contacts. The source file was created with Contacts Backup by John Li: http://www.windowsphone.com/fi-fi/store/app/contacts-backup/7cc19164-76dc-4f13-93d3-a368fa864d56.

If your contact names have commas in them, you need to edit those out manually before using the program.

Source format example:

    Jacob,04011111
    Steve,+241000000
